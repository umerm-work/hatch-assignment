If I had more time I would have

- structured react with best practices
- used docker to containerize both backend and frontend
- tested backend endpoints

### Design Decisions

Technologies Used

- React with boilerplate
- gqlgen
- postgres
- GORM
- Viper for configuration

### Backend Layers
 - Data (Contains Models)
 - Infrastructure (composed of frameworks and tools)
 - Presentation (Input and output data transformation)
 - Graph(Generated files and resolvers)

I wanted to add the use case layer for business logic to have more flexibility but skip it to save time.
